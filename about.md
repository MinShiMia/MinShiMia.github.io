I am a passionate data scientist with a strong background in data analytics and research. During my Ph.D. studies, I developed a deep fascination for the world of data and honed my skills in business analytics and model building through master's programs in Social Data Analytics and Research and Business Analytics at UTD.

As a research assistant, I have gained extensive experience in data collection, cleaning, quantitative modeling, statistical analytics, and report writing for collaborative research projects in global health, political economy, and public policy. I have also supervised undergraduate research assistants, ensuring project success and timely completion.

In addition to my academic work, I have practical experience as a database management intern, where I utilized tools like MySQL and Microsoft Visio to streamline data processes and create impactful business analytics reports. I have led and collaborated on diverse group projects, ranging from designing payroll management systems to handling big geospatial data using Hadoop and Spark.

If you're interested in connecting or discussing potential collaborations, I would love to hear from you. Let's leverage the power of data to drive meaningful insights and make a positive impact together.
